## How To

### Install Node Libraries

The first thing to do is to install the libraries.
Open a shell inside the root folder.

```bash
npm install
```

Now, you should have a sub-folder *node_modules*

### Run Server

To make the server run:

```bash
npm run start
```

The server will be opened on *localhost:3000*.

### Check JS Syntax with Eslint

For developers only: To make sure the code is well written, please run this command several times during your development work.

```bash
npm run lint
```

If nothing happens, everything is right. Else, warnings or errors will be written there.
